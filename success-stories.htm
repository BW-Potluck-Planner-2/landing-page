            <h3>Potlucky Got Me Promoted</h3>
            <p>I was the new guy at the office. So of course everyone thought it would be hilarious if they put me in charge of the company potluck. They were certain of my failure. But little did they know I had discovered a secret weapon--Potlucky. With Potlucky it was easy to make sure there was more than chips and salsa at our event. In fact, it turned out to be the best potluck in company history. My boss noticed, and now I’m a VP! Thanks Potlucky!

            <h3>Potlucky In Love</h3>
            <p>My love life was on the skids. No matter how hard I tried, whenever I planned a potluck, we’d have way too much zucchini bread. And the ladies would notice. Then, I heard about Potlucky from a friend and figured I’d give it a try. I mean why, not, things couldn’t get any worse. Well I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Potlucky was very easy to use. And the best part, at my next potluck, everyone brought something different! There was still plenty of zucchini bread, but not too much. All of a sudden I was very popular--I got 3 phone numbers that day.</p>

            <h3>Jesus &hearts; Potlucky</h3>
            <p>My church potluck party was coming up, and I was really nervous. I prayed for some help and all of a sudden I saw a blinding light and heard a voice say, “Potlucky will save you!” So I went to my computer and searched for Potlucky, and lo and behold there it was. Just what I needed to throw the best Potluck my congregation had ever seen.
